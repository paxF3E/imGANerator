- large JSONs were processed to extract the actual text annotations for encoding with skipthoughts
- encoding entire JSONs in parent directory `..` led to memory leak and excessive execution time
- every JSON for `{[caption, stuff, instances]x[train, val]}` was split on the basis of immediate children
- then they were readable and those with vectorizable/encodable text were moved to `.`
